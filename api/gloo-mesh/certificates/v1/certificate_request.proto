/*
    CertificateRequests are generated by the Gloo Mesh agent installed on managed clusters.
    They are used to request a signed certificate from the certificate issuer (the Gloo Mesh server) based on a private key
    generated by the agent (which never leaves the managed cluster).

    When Gloo Mesh creates an IssuedCertificate on a managed cluster, the local Gloo Mesh Agent
    will generate a CertificateRequest corresponding to it.

    Gloo Mesh will then process the certificate signing request contained in the
    `CertificateRequestSpec` and write the signed SSL certificate back as a Kubernetes secret in the managed cluster,
    and update the `CertificateRequestStatus` to point to that secret.
