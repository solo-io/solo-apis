/*
    IssuedCertificates are used to issue SSL certificates
    to remote Kubernetes clusters from a central (out-of-cluster) Certificate Authority.

    When an IssuedCertificate is created, a certificate is issued to a remote cluster by a central Certificate Authority via
    the following workflow:

    1. The Certificate Issuer creates the IssuedCertificate resource on the remote cluster
    2. The Certificate Signature Requesting Agent installed to the remote cluster generates
      a Certificate Signing Request and writes it to the status of the IssuedCertificate
    3. Finally, the Certificate Issuer generates signed a certificate for the CSR and writes
      it back as Kubernetes Secret in the remote cluster.

    Trust can therefore be established across clusters without requiring
    private keys to ever leave the node.
