/*
    CertificateVerification is the resource by which a user can verify the traffic
    during a VirtualMesh certificate rotation.

    To do this, a user would create a CertificateVerification containing:
    1. The step being verified
    2. The action which the user would like to kick off
    3. The VirtualMesh being rotated


    An example of a Verification for a Virtual Mesh which has just added a new root successfully would be:
```yaml
    apiVersion: networking.enterprise.mesh.gloo.solo.io/v1beta1
    kind: CertificateVerification
    metadata:
      name: successful-verification
      namespace: gloo-mesh
    spec:
      action: CONTINUE
      virtualMesh:
        name: my-virtual-mesh
        namespace: gloo-mesh
      step: ADDING_NEW_ROOT
```

  An example of a Verification  for a Virtual Mesh which has failed to propagate the new intermediate would be
  the following: In addition this example does not specify a namespace for the virtualMesh because it is
  in the same namesapce as the CertificateVerification.
```yaml
    apiVersion: networking.enterprise.mesh.gloo.solo.io/v1beta1
    kind: CertificateVerification
    metadata:
      name: successful-verification
      namespace: gloo-mesh
    spec:
      action: ROLLBACK
      virtualMesh:
        name: my-virtual-mesh
      step: PROPAGATING_NEW_INTERMEDIATE
```
