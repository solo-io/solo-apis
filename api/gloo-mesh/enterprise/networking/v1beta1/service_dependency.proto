/*
    A ServiceDependency specifies explicit dependencies between traffic sources and destinations in a service graph.
    Depending on the underlying service mesh, explicitly describing dependencies can improve the performance
    of the data plane by pruning away any unneeded networking configuration from the relevant proxies.

    The complete set of service dependencies for a given traffic source is the aggregation of all
    unique Destinations selected by any applicable ServiceDependencies. If a traffic source has no applied
    ServiceDependencies, its service dependency configuration defaults to the behavior of the underlying service mesh.

    Note that in order to block communication between sources and destinations not explicitly declared
    in a ServiceDependency, additional configuration on the underlying service mesh may be required.
    For instance, Istio must be configured with `outboundTrafficPolicy.Mode` set to `REGISTRY_ONLY` (see [here](https://istio.io/latest/docs/reference/config/istio.mesh.v1alpha1/#MeshConfig-OutboundTrafficPolicy))
    to enforce this behavior.
